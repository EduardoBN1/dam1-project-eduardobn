			Based upon the friendship and eventual breakdown between <strong>Bill Gates</strong> and <strong>Steve Jobs</strong> in the very early startup days of Microsoft and Apple from their home garages. This film does a great job of showing it’s about being the first to have an idea, it’s about who’s first to act on it properly and with passion, exemplified by their "theft" of the first GUI system from Xerox.
